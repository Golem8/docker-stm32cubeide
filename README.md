Create an image using the dockerfile. You will need the zipped installer for stm32cubeide, named installer.sh.zip. This can be downloaded from ST's website. You will also need the autoinstall.sh file. Put the installer, the autoinstall.sh, and the dockerfile in the same directory before building the dockerfile. Use stmcubeide version 1.7.0
